Clean-Note is a brand-new social network
which is aimed to be a clone of Twitter,
Facebook and if i can YouTube.

Clean-Note uses the following concepts:
- There are not friends, there are followers

- Follow and unfollow system
- Comment in posts
- Like comments and reply to them

- Add the stats (post footer) to every page where it's needed
- To do the "get the following accounts posts" like i did with the liked
